## Hello there, I'm Antoine!

I like **technology and collaborative projects**, I worked within two Horizon 2020 projects, EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The overall objective is to create an innovative framework on ICT tools and services that can be deployed in cities to improve the health of the population in the urban context. 


**Embedded Systems Engineer**, I received a master's degree from ECE Paris and had the opportunity to share my time between Europe and Asia. I specialized in Internet-of-Things, playing around with electronics components and controllers.

## How to learn Machine Learning in a fun way

Recently, I've started to study **Machine Learning** using Sci-kit Learn.
On of my latest fun work is applying Logistic Regression and Decision Tree on the RMS Titanic Dataset.

## ML models and Python packages

Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist.

```python
from sklearn import linear_model
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
```

In contrast to linear regression, logistic regression does not produce an ùëÖ2 score by which we can assess the accuracy of our model. In order to evaluate that, we will use a classification report, a confusion matrix, and the accuracy score. We import the related tools from sklearn.metrics.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
```
Illustration of my Logistics Regression model:

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

```python
from sklearn import tree
```

## And the results are...

Let's create the data for our lovely couple (we will follow the structure: class, age, parents on board, fare, sex): Jack is on third class, around 27 years old, alone on board, only paid 8$ and is a male `jack = [3, 27, 0, 8, 1]`, and rose is on first class, around 22 years old, with family and paid 60$ `rose = [1, 22, 1, 60, 0]`.
