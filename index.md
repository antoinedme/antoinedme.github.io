Recently, I've started to study **Machine Learning** using Sci-kit Learn.

On of my latest fun work is applying Logistic Regression and Decision Tree on the RMS Titanic Dataset.

## Python packages

Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist.

```python
from sklearn import linear_model
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
```

In contrast to linear regression, logistic regression does not produce an ùëÖ2 score by which we can assess the accuracy of our model. In order to evaluate that, we will use a classification report, a confusion matrix, and the accuracy score. We import the related tools from sklearn.metrics.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
```

Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

```python
from sklearn import tree
```

## Machine Learning Models

To understand both models, I created these 2 illustrations:
